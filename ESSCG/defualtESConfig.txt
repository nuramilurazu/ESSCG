<command>snesemulator %ROM%</command>

<!-- The platform(s) to use when scraping (download box art and such). You can see the full list of accepted platforms below. Everything should be lowercase.

<platform>snes</platform>

<!-- This is the theme to load from the current theme set. This tag is also optional; if not set, it will default to the value of <name>. It is recommended that you use a name from the "Recommended Theme Names" list below to make installing themes as painless as possible.-->
